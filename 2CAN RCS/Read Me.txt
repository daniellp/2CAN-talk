Read before debugging...

	Project was built using Visual Studio 2005.

	To compile this project you must have the Direct X SDK installed.  
	This is because the code uses Direct X to read joystick/gamepad data.

	1) The Direct X SDK can be found at microsoft's site...
		http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/default.aspx

		This code was teste against the February 2010 build of Direct X SDK.
		
	2) After installing the SDK make sure the reference "Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput" shows up 
		correctly under "References" in the Solution explorer.

	3) There is a known issue with debugging when using this version of Direct X where the debugger 
		halts on Loader Lock exceptions.  To bypass this go to the Debug menu option, then Exceptions, 
		then under "Managed Debugging Assistants" uncheck the "on Loader Lock" option.
